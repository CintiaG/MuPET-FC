Description: A graphical user interface tool to estimate ploidy from DNA cells stained with fluorescent dyes and analyzed by flow cytometry, following the methodology of Gómez-Muñoz and Fischer (2024) <doi:10.1101/2024.01.24.577056>. Features include multiple file uploading and configuration, peak fluorescence intensity detection, histogram visualizations, peak error curation, ploidy and genome size calculations, and easy results export.
